Some notes for module 1.

I'm taking a while in this section because I want to do it the most correct and best practice way but that might just be a waste of time.
I could just follow along exactly as the the lectures say for the react web app portion but I'm adamant on doing it the best way.
I have decided to try to use vite instead of the lecture suggested way using create-react-app
The React documentation itself says to no longer use create-react-app because it is deprecated and no longer maintained.
I am using a tutorial from Miguel Grinberg here https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/create-a-react-flask-project-in-2025.
The instructor also suggested Miguel Grinberg for flask tutorials so this works out great.
Miguel recently updated his tutorial on react and flask project to use Vite instead of create-react-app.
